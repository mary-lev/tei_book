# TEI Book Project

This repository contains a sample TEI book dataset and a small React +
TypeScript frontend for viewing the book images. The frontend uses
OpenSeadragon for zooming and panning and Redux Toolkit for state management.

## Frontend

The frontend source lives in the `frontend/` directory. See its
[README](frontend/README.md) for setup instructions.
